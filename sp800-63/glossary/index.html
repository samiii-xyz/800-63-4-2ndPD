<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>A wide variety of terms are used in the realm of digital identity. While many definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful attention to how the terms are defined here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>account linking</dt>
  <dd>The association of multiple <em>federated identifiers</em> with a single <em>RP subscriber account</em>, or the management of those associations.</dd>
  <dt>account recovery</dt>
  <dd>The ability to regain ownership of a <em>subscriber account</em> and its associated information and privileges.</dd>
  <dt>account resolution</dt>
  <dd>The association of an <em>RP subscriber account</em> with information already held by the <em>RP</em> prior to the <em>federation transaction</em> and outside of a <em>trust agreement</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation</dt>
  <dd>The process of inputting an <em>activation factor</em> into a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em> to enable its use for <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation factor</dt>
  <dd>An additional <em>authentication factor</em> that is used to enable successful <em>authentication</em> with a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation secret</dt>
  <dd>A <em>password</em> that is used locally as an <em>activation factor</em> for a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>allowlist</dt>
  <dd>A documented list of specific elements that are allowed, per policy decision. In <em>federation</em> contexts, this is most commonly used to refer to the list of <em>RPs</em> allowed to connect to an <em>IdP</em> without subscriber intervention. This concept has historically been known as a <em>whitelist</em>.</dd>
  <dt>applicant</dt>
  <dd>A <em>subject</em> undergoing the processes of <em>identity proofing</em> and <em>enrollment</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<div latex-literal="true" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\clearpage
</code></pre></div></div>

<dl>
  <dt>applicant reference</dt>
  <dd>A representative of the <em>applicant</em> who can vouch for the identity of the applicant, specific <em>attributes</em> related to the applicant, or conditions relative to the context of the individual (e.g., emergency status, homelessness).</dd>
  <dt>approved cryptography</dt>
  <dd>An encryption algorithm, <em>hash function</em>, random bit generator, or similar technique that is <em>Federal Information Processing Standard</em> (FIPS)-approved or NIST-recommended. Approved algorithms and techniques are either specified or adopted in a FIPS or NIST recommendation.</dd>
  <dt>assertion</dt>
  <dd>A statement from an <em>IdP</em> to an <em>RP</em> that contains information about an authentication event for a subscriber. Assertions can also contain identity <em>attributes</em> for the subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>assertion reference</dt>
  <dd>A data object, created in conjunction with an <em>assertion</em>, that is used by the <em>RP</em> to retrieve an assertion over an <em>authenticated</em> protected channel.</dd>
  <dt>assertion presentation</dt>
  <dd>The method by which an <em>assertion</em> is transmitted to the <em>RP</em>.</dd>
  <dt>asymmetric keys</dt>
  <dd>Two related keys, comprised of a <em>public key</em> and a <em>private key</em>, that are used to perform complementary operations such as encryption and decryption or signature <em>verification</em> and generation.</dd>
  <dt>attestation</dt>
  <dd>Information conveyed to the <em>CSP</em>, generally at the time that an <em>authenticator</em> is bound, describing the characteristics of a connected authenticator or the <em>endpoint</em> involved in an authentication operation.</dd>
  <dt>attribute</dt>
  <dd>A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something. An identity attribute is an attribute about the identity of a subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>attribute bundle</dt>
  <dd>A package  of <em>attribute values</em> and <em>derived attribute values</em> from a <em>CSP</em>. The package has necessary cryptographic protection to allow <em>validation</em> of the bundle independent from interaction with the CSP or <em>IdP</em>. Attribute bundles are often used with subscriber-controlled wallets.</dd>
  <dt>attribute provider</dt>
  <dd>The provider of an <em>identity API</em> that provides access to a subscriber’s attributes without necessarily asserting that the subscriber is present to the <em>RP</em>.</dd>
  <dt>attribute validation</dt>
  <dd>The process or act of confirming that a set of attributes are accurate and associated with a real-life identity. See <em>validation</em>.</dd>
  <dt>attribute value</dt>
  <dd>A complete statement that asserts an identity attribute of a subscriber, independent of format. For example, for the <em>attribute</em> “birthday,” a value could be “12/1/1980” or “December 1, 1980.”</dd>
  <dt>audience restriction</dt>
  <dd>The restriction of a message to a specific target audience to prevent a receiver from unknowingly <em>processing</em> a message intended for another recipient. In <em>federation protocols</em>, <em>assertions</em> are audience <em>restricted</em> to specific <em>RPs</em> to prevent an RP from accepting an assertion generated for a different RP.</dd>
  <dt>authenticate</dt>
  <dd>See <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated protected channel</dt>
  <dd>An encrypted communication channel that uses <em>approved cryptography</em> where the connection initiator (client) has authenticated the recipient (server). Authenticated protected channels are encrypted to provide confidentiality and protection against active intermediaries and are frequently used in the user <em>authentication</em> process. <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63/references/#ref-rfc9325">[RFC9325]</a> are examples of authenticated protected channels in which the certificate presented by the recipient is verified by the initiator. Unless otherwise specified, authenticated protected channels do not require the server to authenticate the client. Authentication of the server is often accomplished through a certificate chain that leads to a trusted root rather than individually with each server.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated session</dt>
  <dd>See <em>protected session</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authentication</dt>
  <dd>The process by which a <em>claimant</em> proves possession and control of one or more <em>authenticators</em> bound to a <em>subscriber account</em> to demonstrate that they are the subscriber associated with that account.</dd>
  <dt>Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)</dt>
  <dd>A category that describes the strength of the authentication process.</dd>
  <dt>authentication factor</dt>
  <dd>The three types of authentication factors are <em>something you know</em>, <em>something you have</em>, and <em>something you are</em>. Every <em>authenticator</em> has one or more authentication factors.</dd>
  <dt>authentication intent</dt>
  <dd>The process of confirming the <em>claimant’s</em> intent to <em>authenticate</em> or reauthenticate by requiring user intervention in the authentication flow. Some <em>authenticators</em> (e.g., OTPs) establish authentication intent as part of their operation. Others require a specific step, such as pressing a button, to establish intent. Authentication intent is a countermeasure against use by malware at the <em>endpoint</em> as a proxy for authenticating an attacker without the subscriber’s knowledge.</dd>
  <dt>authentication protocol</dt>
  <dd>A defined sequence of messages between a <em>claimant</em> and a <em>verifier</em> that demonstrates that the claimant has possession and control of one or more valid <em>authenticators</em> to establish their identity, and, optionally, demonstrates that the claimant is communicating with the intended verifier.</dd>
  <dt>authentication secret</dt>
  <dd>A generic term for any secret value that an attacker could use to impersonate the subscriber in an <em>authentication protocol</em>.

    <p>These are further divided into <em>short-term authentication secrets</em>, which are only useful to an attacker for a limited period of time, and <em>long-term authentication secrets</em>, which allow an attacker to impersonate the subscriber until they are manually reset. The <em>authenticator</em> secret is the canonical example of a long-term authentication secret, while the <em>authenticator output</em> — if it is different from the <em>authenticator secret</em> — is usually a short-term authentication secret.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>authenticator</dt>
  <dd>Something that the subscriber possesses and controls (e.g., a <em>cryptographic module</em> or <em>password</em>) and that is used to <em>authenticate</em> a <em>claimant’s</em> identity. See <em>authenticator type</em> and <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator binding</dt>
  <dd>The establishment of an association between a specific <em>authenticator</em> and a <em>subscriber account</em> that allows the <em>authenticator</em> to be used to <em>authenticate</em> for that subscriber account, possibly in conjunction with other authenticators.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator output</dt>
  <dd>The output value generated by an <em>authenticator</em>. The ability to generate valid authenticator outputs on demand proves that the <em>claimant</em> possesses and controls the authenticator. Protocol messages sent to the <em>verifier</em> depend on the authenticator output, but they may or may not explicitly contain it.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator secret</dt>
  <dd>The secret value contained within an <em>authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator type</dt>
  <dd>A category of <em>authenticators</em> with common characteristics, such as the types of <em>authentication factors</em> they provide and the mechanisms by which they operate.</dd>
  <dt>authenticity</dt>
  <dd>The property that data originated from its purported source.</dd>
  <dt>authoritative source</dt>
  <dd>An entity that has access to or verified copies of accurate information from an <em>issuing source</em> such that a <em>CSP</em> has high confidence that the source can confirm the validity of the identity attributes or evidence supplied by an <em>applicant</em> during <em>identity proofing</em>. An issuing source may also be an authoritative source. Often, authoritative sources are determined by a policy decision of the agency or CSP before they can be used in the identity proofing <em>validation</em> phase.</dd>
  <dt>authorize</dt>
  <dd>A decision to grant access, typically automated by evaluating a <em>subject</em>’s <em>attributes</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authorized party</dt>
  <dd>In <em>federation</em>, the organization, person, or entity that is responsible for making decisions regarding the release of information within the <em>federation transaction</em>, most notably subscriber <em>attributes</em>. This is often the subscriber (when runtime decisions are used) or the party operating the <em>IdP</em> (when <em>allowlists</em> are used).</dd>
  <dt>back-channel communication</dt>
  <dd>Communication between two systems that relies on a direct connection without using redirects through an intermediary such as a browser.</dd>
  <dt>bearer assertion</dt>
  <dd>An <em>assertion</em> that can be presented on its own as proof of the identity of the presenter.</dd>
</dl>

<div latex-literal="true" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\clearpage

<dl>
  <dt>biometric reference</dt>
  <dd>One or more stored <em>biometric samples</em>, templates, or models attributed to an individual and used as the object of biometric comparison in a database, such as a facial image stored digitally on a passport, fingerprint minutiae template on a National ID card or Gaussian Mixture Model for speaker recognition.</dd>
  <dt>biometric sample</dt>
  <dd>An analog or digital representation of biometric characteristics prior to biometric feature extraction, such as a record that contains a fingerprint image.</dd>
  <dt>biometrics</dt>
  <dd>Automated recognition of individuals based on their biological or behavioral characteristics. Biological characteristics include but are not limited to fingerprints, palm prints, facial features, iris and retina patterns, voiceprints, and vein patterns. Behavioral characteristics include but are not limited to keystrokes, angle of holding a smart phone, screen pressure, typing speed, mouse or mobile phone movements, and gyroscope position.</dd>
  <dt>blocklist</dt>
  <dd>A documented list of specific elements that are blocked, per policy decision. This concept has historically been known as a <em>blacklist</em>.</dd>
  <dt>challenge-response protocol</dt>
  <dd>An <em>authentication protocol</em> in which the <em>verifier</em> sends the <em>claimant</em> a challenge (e.g., a random value or <em>nonce</em>) that the claimant combines with a secret (e.g., by hashing the challenge and a <em>shared secret</em> together or by applying a <em>private-key</em> operation to the challenge) to generate a response that is sent to the verifier. The verifier can independently verify the response generated by the claimant (e.g., by re-computing the hash of the challenge and the shared secret and comparing to the response or performing a public-key operation on the response) and establish that the claimant possesses and controls the secret.</dd>
  <dt>claimant</dt>
  <dd>A <em>subject</em> whose identity is to be verified using one or more <em>authentication protocols</em>.</dd>
  <dt>claimed address</dt>
  <dd>The physical location asserted by a <em>subject</em> where they can be reached. It includes the individual’s residential street address and may also include their mailing address.</dd>
  <dt>claimed identity</dt>

  <dt>tailoring</dt>
  <dd>The process by which xALs and specified <em>controls</em> are modified by: considerations for the impacts on privacy, <em>usability</em>, and <em>equity</em> on the user population, identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping considerations on the applicability and implementation of specified controls, selecting any <em>compensating controls</em>, assigning specific values to organization-defined security control parameters, supplementing xAL controls with additional controls or control enhancements, and providing additional specification information for control implementation.</dd>

  <dt>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</dt>
  <dd>An authentication and security protocol widely implemented in browsers and web servers. TLS is defined by <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63/references/#ref-RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a>. TLS is similar to the older SSL protocol, and TLS 1.0 is effectively SSL version 3.1. SP 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63/references/#ref-SP800-52">[SP800-52]</a>, specifies how TLS is to be used in government applications.</dd>
  <dt>trust agreement</dt>
  <dd>A set of conditions under which a <em>CSP</em>, <em>IdP</em>, and <em>RP</em> are allowed to participate in a <em>federation transaction</em> for the purposes of establishing an authentication <em>session</em> between the subscriber and the RP.</dd>
  <dt>trust anchor</dt>
  <dd>A public or <em>symmetric key</em> that is trusted because it is built directly into hardware or software or securely provisioned via out-of-band means rather than because it is vouched for by another trusted entity (e.g., in a <em>public key</em> certificate). A trust anchor may have name or policy constraints that limit its scope.</dd>
  <dt>trusted referee</dt>
  <dd>An agent of the <em>CSP</em> who is trained to make risk-based decisions regarding an <em>applicant’s</em> <em>identity proofing</em> case when that applicant is unable to meet the expected requirements of a defined IAL proofing process.</dd>
  <dt>usability</dt>
  <dd>The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use. <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63/references/#ref-ISOIEC9241">[ISO/IEC9241-11]</a></dd>
  <dt>validation</dt>
  <dd>The process or act of checking and confirming that the evidence and <em>attributes</em> supplied by an <em>applicant</em> are authentic, accurate and associated with a real-life identity. Specifically, evidence validation is the process or act of checking that the presented evidence is authentic, current, and issued from an acceptable source. See also <em>attribute validation</em>.</dd>
  <dt>verification</dt>
  <dd>The process or act of confirming that the <em>applicant</em> undergoing <em>identity proofing</em> holds the claimed real-life identity represented by the validated identity <em>attributes</em> and associated evidence. Synonymous with “identity verification.”</dd>
  <dt>verifier</dt>
  <dd>An entity that verifies the <em>claimant’s</em> identity by verifying the claimant’s possession and control of one or more <em>authenticators</em> using an <em>authentication protocol</em>. To do this, the verifier needs to confirm the binding of the authenticators with the <em>subscriber account</em> and check that the subscriber account is active.</dd>
  <dt>verifier impersonation</dt>
  <dd>See <em>phishing</em>.</dd>
  <dt>zeroize</dt>
  <dd>Overwrite a memory location with data that consists entirely of bits with the value zero so that the data is destroyed and unrecoverable. This is often contrasted with deletion methods that merely destroy references to data within a file system rather than the data itself.</dd>
  <dt>zero-knowledge password protocol</dt>
  <dd>A password-based <em>authentication protocol</em> that allows a <em>claimant</em> to <em>authenticate</em> to a <em>verifier</em> without revealing the <em>password</em> to the verifier. Examples of such protocols are EKE, SPEKE and SRP.</dd>
