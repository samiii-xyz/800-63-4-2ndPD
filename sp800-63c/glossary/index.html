</h1>
    

<p>A wide variety of terms are used in the realm of digital identity. While many definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful attention to how the terms are defined here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>account linking</dt>
  <dd>The association of multiple <em>federated identifiers</em> with a single <em>RP subscriber account</em>, or the management of those associations.</dd>
  <dt>account resolution</dt>
  <dd>The association of an <em>RP subscriber account</em> with information already held by the <em>RP</em> prior to the <em>federation transaction</em> and outside of a <em>trust agreement</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation factor</dt>
  <dd>An additional <em>authentication factor</em> that is used to enable successful <em>authentication</em> with a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>allowlist</dt>
  <dd>A documented list of specific elements that are allowed, per policy decision. In <em>federation</em> contexts, this is most commonly used to refer to the list of <em>RPs</em> allowed to connect to an <em>IdP</em> without subscriber intervention. This concept has historically been known as a <em>whitelist</em>.</dd>
  <dt>approved cryptography</dt>
  <dd>An encryption algorithm, <em>hash function</em>, random bit generator, or similar technique that is <em>Federal Information Processing Standard</em> (FIPS)-approved or NIST-recommended. Approved algorithms and techniques are either specified or adopted in a FIPS or NIST recommendation.</dd>
  <dt>assertion</dt>
  <dd>A statement from an <em>IdP</em> to an <em>RP</em> that contains information about an authentication event for a subscriber. Assertions can also contain identity <em>attributes</em> for the subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>assertion reference</dt>
  <dd>A data object, created in conjunction with an <em>assertion</em>, that is used by the <em>RP</em> to retrieve an assertion over an <em>authenticated</em> protected channel.</dd>
  <dt>assertion presentation</dt>
  <dd>The method by which an <em>assertion</em> is transmitted to the <em>RP</em>.</dd>
  <dt>asymmetric keys</dt>
  <dd>Two related keys, comprised of a <em>public key</em> and a <em>private key</em>, that are used to perform complementary operations such as encryption and decryption or signature <em>verification</em> and generation.</dd>
  <dt>attribute</dt>
  <dd>A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something. An identity attribute is an attribute about the identity of a subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>attribute bundle</dt>
  <dd>A package  of <em>attribute values</em> and <em>derived attribute values</em> from a <em>CSP</em>. The package has necessary cryptographic protection to allow <em>validation</em> of the bundle independent from interaction with the CSP or <em>IdP</em>. Attribute bundles are often used with subscriber-controlled wallets.</dd>
  <dt>attribute provider</dt>
  <dd>The provider of an <em>identity API</em> that provides access to a subscriber’s attributes without necessarily asserting that the subscriber is present to the <em>RP</em>.</dd>
  <dt>attribute value</dt>
  <dd>A complete statement that asserts an identity attribute of a subscriber, independent of format. For example, for the <em>attribute</em> “birthday,” a value could be “12/1/1980” or “December 1, 1980.”</dd>
  <dt>audience restriction</dt>
  <dd>The restriction of a message to a specific target audience to prevent a receiver from unknowingly <em>processing</em> a message intended for another recipient. In <em>federation protocols</em>, <em>assertions</em> are audience <em>restricted</em> to specific <em>RPs</em> to prevent an RP from accepting an assertion generated for a different RP.</dd>
  <dt>authenticate</dt>
  <dd>See <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated protected channel</dt>
  <dd>An encrypted communication channel that uses <em>approved cryptography</em> where the connection initiator (client) has authenticated the recipient (server). Authenticated protected channels are encrypted to provide confidentiality and protection against active intermediaries and are frequently used in the user <em>authentication</em> process. <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63c/references/#ref-rfc9325">[RFC9325]</a> are examples of authenticated protected channels in which the certificate presented by the recipient is verified by the initiator. Unless otherwise specified, authenticated protected channels do not require the server to authenticate the client. Authentication of the server is often accomplished through a certificate chain that leads to a trusted root rather than individually with each server.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated session</dt>
  <dd>See <em>protected session</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authentication</dt>
  <dd>The process by which a <em>claimant</em> proves possession and control of one or more <em>authenticators</em> bound to a <em>subscriber account</em> to demonstrate that they are the subscriber associated with that account.</dd>
  <dt>Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)</dt>
  <dd>A category describing the strength of the authentication process.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator</dt>
  <dd>Something that the subscriber possesses and controls (e.g., a <em>cryptographic module</em> or <em>password</em>) and that is used to <em>authenticate</em> a <em>claimant’s</em> identity. See <em>authenticator type</em> and <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator binding</dt>
  <dd>The establishment of an association between a specific <em>authenticator</em> and a <em>subscriber account</em> that allows the <em>authenticator</em> to be used to <em>authenticate</em> for that subscriber account, possibly in conjunction with other authenticators.</dd>
  <dt>authorize</dt>
  <dd>A decision to grant access, typically automated by evaluating a <em>subject</em>’s <em>attributes</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authorized party</dt>
  <dd>In <em>federation</em>, the organization, person, or entity that is responsible for making decisions regarding the release of information within the <em>federation transaction</em>, most notably subscriber <em>attributes</em>. This is often the subscriber (when runtime decisions are used) or the party operating the <em>IdP</em> (when <em>allowlists</em> are used).</dd>
  <dt>back-channel communication</dt>
  <dd>Communication between two systems that relies on a direct connection without using redirects through an intermediary such as a browser.</dd>
  <dt>bearer assertion</dt>
  <dd>An <em>assertion</em> that can be presented on its own as proof of the identity of the presenter.</dd>
  <dt>blocklist</dt>
  <dd>A documented list of specific elements that are blocked, per policy decision. This concept has historically been known as a <em>blacklist</em>.</dd>
  <dt>challenge-response protocol</dt>
  <dd>An <em>authentication protocol</em> in which the <em>verifier</em> sends the <em>claimant</em> a challenge (e.g., a random value or <em>nonce</em>) that the claimant combines with a secret (e.g., by hashing the challenge and a <em>shared secret</em> together or by applying a <em>private-key</em> operation to the challenge) to generate a response that is sent to the verifier. The verifier can independently verify the response generated by the claimant (e.g., by re-computing the hash of the challenge and the shared secret and comparing to the response or performing a public-key operation on the response) and establish that the claimant possesses and controls the secret.</dd>
  <dt>core attributes</dt>
  <dd>The set of identity <em>attributes</em> that the <em>CSP</em> has determined and documented to be required for <em>identity proofing</em>.</dd>
  <dt>credential service provider (CSP)</dt>
  <dd>A trusted entity whose functions include <em>identity proofing</em> <em>applicants</em> to the identity service and registering <em>authenticators</em> to <em>subscriber accounts</em>. A CSP may be an independent third party.</dd>
  <dt>cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</dt>
  <dd>An attack in which a subscriber who is currently <em>authenticated</em> to an <em>RP</em> and connected through a secure session browses an attacker’s website, causing the subscriber to unknowingly invoke unwanted actions at the RP.

    <p>For example, if a bank website is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, it may be possible for a subscriber to unintentionally <em>authorize</em> a large money transfer by clicking on a malicious link in an email while a connection to the bank is open in another browser window.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>cross-site scripting (XSS)</dt>
  <dd>A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into an otherwise benign website. These scripts acquire the permissions of scripts generated by the target website to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transfers between the website and clients. Websites are vulnerable if they display user-supplied data from requests or forms without sanitizing the data so that it is not executable.</dd>
  <dt>derived attribute value</dt>
  <dd>A statement that asserts a limited identity <em>attribute</em> of a subscriber without containing the attribute value from which it is derived, independent of format. For example, instead of requesting the attribute “birthday,” a derived value could be “older than 18”. Instead of requesting the attribute for “physical address,” a derived value could be “currently residing in this district.” Previous versions of these guidelines referred to this construct as an “attribute reference.”</dd>

  <dt>entropy</dt>
  <dd>The amount of uncertainty that an attacker faces to determine the value of a secret. Entropy is usually stated in bits. A value with <em>n</em> bits of entropy has the same degree of uncertainty as a uniformly distributed <em>n</em>-bit random value.</dd>
  <dt>equity</dt>
  <dd>The consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63c/references/#ref-EO13985">[EO13985]</a></dd>
  <dt>Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)</dt>
  <dd>Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106), the Secretary of Commerce approves the standards and guidelines that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops for federal computer systems.

  <dd>A <em>session</em> in which messages between two participants are encrypted and integrity is protected using a set of <em>shared secrets</em> called “session keys.”

    <p>A protected session is said to be <em>authenticated</em> if — during the session — one participant proves possession of one or more <em>authenticators</em> in addition to the session keys, and if the other party can verify the identity associated with the authenticators. If both participants are authenticated, the protected session is said to be <em>mutually authenticated</em>.</p>

  <dt>public key</dt>
  <dd>The public part of an <em>asymmetric key</em> pair that is used to verify signatures or encrypt data.</dd>
  <dt>public key certificate</dt>
  <dd>A digital document issued and digitally signed by the <em>private key</em> of a certificate authority that binds an <em>identifier</em> to a subscriber’s <em>public key</em>. The certificate indicates that the subscriber identified in the certificate has sole control of and access to the private key. See also <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63c/references/#ref-RFC5280">[RFC5280]</a>.</dd>
  <dt>public key infrastructure (PKI)</dt>

  <dt>risk assessment</dt>
  <dd>The process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, and other organizations that result from the operation of a system. A risk assessment is part of <em>risk management</em>, incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses, and considers mitigations provided by security <em>controls</em> that are planned or in-place. It is synonymous with “risk analysis.”</dd>
  <dt>risk management</dt>
  <dd>The program and supporting processes that manage information security risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, and other organizations and includes (i) establishing the context for risk-related activities, (ii) assessing risk, (iii) responding to risk once determined, and (iv) monitoring risk over time.</dd>
  <dt>RP subscriber account</dt>
  <dd>An account established and managed by the <em>RP</em> in a federated system based on the RP’s view of the <em>subscriber account</em> from the <em>IdP</em>.

  <dd>An authentication and security protocol widely implemented in browsers and web servers. TLS is defined by <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63c/references/#ref-RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a>. TLS is similar to the older SSL protocol, and TLS 1.0 is effectively SSL version 3.1. SP 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63c/references/#ref-SP800-52">[SP800-52]</a>, specifies how TLS is to be used in government applications.</dd>
