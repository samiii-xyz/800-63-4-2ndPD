<p>A wide variety of terms are used in the realm of digital identity. While many definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful attention to how the terms are defined here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>account recovery</dt>
  <dd>The ability to regain ownership of a <em>subscriber account</em> and its associated information and privileges.</dd>
  <dt>activation</dt>
  <dd>The process of inputting an <em>activation factor</em> into a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em> to enable its use for <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation factor</dt>
  <dd>An additional <em>authentication factor</em> that is used to enable successful <em>authentication</em> with a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>activation secret</dt>
  <dd>A <em>password</em> that is used locally as an <em>activation factor</em> for a <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>approved cryptography</dt>
  <dd>An encryption algorithm, <em>hash function</em>, random bit generator, or similar technique that is <em>Federal Information Processing Standard</em> (FIPS)-approved or NIST-recommended. Approved algorithms and techniques are either specified or adopted in a FIPS or NIST recommendation.</dd>
  <dt>assertion</dt>
  <dd>A statement from an <em>IdP</em> to an <em>RP</em> that contains information about an authentication event for a subscriber. Assertions can also contain identity <em>attributes</em> for the subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>asymmetric keys</dt>
  <dd>Two related keys, comprised of a <em>public key</em> and a <em>private key</em>, that are used to perform complementary operations such as encryption and decryption or signature <em>verification</em> and generation.</dd>
  <dt>attestation</dt>
  <dd>Information conveyed to the <em>CSP</em>, generally at the time that an <em>authenticator</em> is bound, describing the characteristics of a connected authenticator or the <em>endpoint</em> involved in an authentication operation.</dd>
  <dt>attribute</dt>
  <dd>A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something. An identity attribute is an attribute about the identity of a subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>authenticate</dt>
  <dd>See <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated protected channel</dt>
  <dd>An encrypted communication channel that uses <em>approved cryptography</em> where the connection initiator (client) has authenticated the recipient (server). Authenticated protected channels are encrypted to provide confidentiality and protection against active intermediaries and are frequently used in the user <em>authentication</em> process. <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63b/references/#ref-rfc9325">[RFC9325]</a> are examples of authenticated protected channels in which the certificate presented by the recipient is verified by the initiator. Unless otherwise specified, authenticated protected channels do not require the server to authenticate the client. Authentication of the server is often accomplished through a certificate chain that leads to a trusted root rather than individually with each server.</dd>
  <dt>authenticated session</dt>
  <dd>See <em>protected session</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authentication</dt>
  <dd>The process by which a <em>claimant</em> proves possession and control of one or more <em>authenticators</em> bound to a <em>subscriber account</em> to demonstrate that they are the subscriber associated with that account.</dd>
  <dt>Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)</dt>
  <dd>A category that describes the strength of the authentication process.</dd>
  <dt>authentication factor</dt>
  <dd>The three types of authentication factors are <em>something you know</em>, <em>something you have</em>, and <em>something you are</em>. Every <em>authenticator</em> has one or more authentication factors.</dd>
  <dt>authentication intent</dt>
  <dd>The process of confirming the <em>claimant’s</em> intent to <em>authenticate</em> or reauthenticate by requiring user intervention in the authentication flow. Some <em>authenticators</em> (e.g., OTPs) establish authentication intent as part of their operation. Others require a specific step, such as pressing a button, to establish intent. Authentication intent is a countermeasure against use by malware at the <em>endpoint</em> as a proxy for authenticating an attacker without the subscriber’s knowledge.</dd>
  <dt>authentication protocol</dt>
  <dd>A defined sequence of messages between a <em>claimant</em> and a <em>verifier</em> that demonstrates that the claimant has possession and control of one or more valid <em>authenticators</em> to establish their identity, and, optionally, demonstrates that the claimant is communicating with the intended verifier.</dd>
  <dt>authentication secret</dt>
  <dd>A generic term for any secret value that an attacker could use to impersonate the subscriber in an <em>authentication protocol</em>.

    <p>These are further divided into <em>short-term authentication secrets</em>, which are only useful to an attacker for a limited period of time, and <em>long-term authentication secrets</em>, which allow an attacker to impersonate the subscriber until they are manually reset. The <em>authenticator</em> secret is the canonical example of a long-term authentication secret, while the <em>authenticator output</em> — if it is different from the <em>authenticator secret</em> — is usually a short-term authentication secret.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>authenticator</dt>
  <dd>Something that the subscriber possesses and controls (e.g., a <em>cryptographic module</em> or <em>password</em>) and that is used to <em>authenticate</em> a <em>claimant’s</em> identity. See <em>authenticator type</em> and <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator binding</dt>

NIST develops FIPS when there are compelling federal government requirements, such as for security and interoperability, and there are no acceptable industry standards or solutions. See background information for more details.
