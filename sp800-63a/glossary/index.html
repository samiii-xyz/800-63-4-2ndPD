<p><em>This section is informative.</em></p>

<p>A wide variety of terms are used in the realm of digital identity. While many definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful attention to how the terms are defined here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>applicant</dt>
  <dd>A <em>subject</em> undergoing the processes of <em>identity proofing</em> and <em>enrollment</em>.</dd>
  <dt>applicant reference</dt>
  <dd>A representative of the <em>applicant</em> who can vouch for the identity of the applicant, specific <em>attributes</em> related to the applicant, or conditions relative to the context of the individual (e.g., emergency status, homelessness).</dd>
  <dt>approved cryptography</dt>
  <dd>An encryption algorithm, <em>hash function</em>, random bit generator, or similar technique that is <em>Federal Information Processing Standard</em> (FIPS)-approved or NIST-recommended. Approved algorithms and techniques are either specified or adopted in a FIPS or NIST recommendation.</dd>
  <dt>assertion</dt>
  <dd>A statement from an <em>IdP</em> to an <em>RP</em> that contains information about an authentication event for a subscriber. Assertions can also contain identity <em>attributes</em> for the subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>attribute</dt>
  <dd>A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something. An identity attribute is an attribute about the identity of a subscriber.</dd>
  <dt>attribute validation</dt>
  <dd>The process or act of confirming that a set of attributes are accurate and associated with a real-life identity. See <em>validation</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticate</dt>
  <dd>See <em>authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authentication</dt>
  <dd>The process by which a <em>claimant</em> proves possession and control of one or more <em>authenticators</em> bound to a <em>subscriber account</em> to demonstrate that they are the subscriber associated with that account.</dd>
  <dt>Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)</dt>
  <dd>A category that describes the strength of the authentication process.</dd>
  <dt>authenticator</dt>
  <dd>Something that the subscriber possesses and controls (e.g., a <em>cryptographic module</em> or <em>password</em>) and that is used to <em>authenticate</em> a <em>claimant’s</em> identity. See <em>authenticator type</em> and <em>multi-factor authenticator</em>.</dd>
  <dt>authenticity</dt>
  <dd>The property that data originated from its purported source.</dd>
  <dt>authoritative source</dt>
  <dd>An entity that has access to or verified copies of accurate information from an <em>issuing source</em> such that a <em>CSP</em> has high confidence that the source can confirm the validity of the identity attributes or evidence supplied by an <em>applicant</em> during <em>identity proofing</em>. An issuing source may also be an authoritative source. Often, authoritative sources are determined by a policy decision of the agency or CSP before they can be used in the identity proofing <em>validation</em> phase.</dd>
  <dt>authorize</dt>
  <dd>A decision to grant access, typically automated by evaluating a <em>subject</em>’s <em>attributes</em>.</dd>
  <dt>biometric reference</dt>
  <dd>One or more stored <em>biometric samples</em>, templates, or models attributed to an individual and used as the object of biometric comparison in a database, such as a facial image stored digitally on a passport, fingerprint minutiae template on a National ID card or Gaussian Mixture Model for speaker recognition.</dd>
  <dt>biometric sample</dt>
  <dd>An analog or digital representation of biometric characteristics prior to biometric feature extraction, such as a record that contains a fingerprint image.</dd>
  <dt>biometrics</dt>
  <dd>Automated recognition of individuals based on their biological or behavioral characteristics. Biological characteristics include but are not limited to fingerprints, palm prints, facial features, iris and retina patterns, voiceprints, and vein patterns. Behavioral characteristics include but are not limited to keystrokes, angle of holding a smart phone, screen pressure, typing speed, mouse or mobile phone movements, and gyroscope position.</dd>
  <dt>claimant</dt>
  <dd>A <em>subject</em> whose identity is to be verified using one or more <em>authentication protocols</em>.</dd>
  <dt>claimed address</dt>
  <dd>The physical location asserted by a <em>subject</em> where they can be reached. It includes the individual’s residential street address and may also include their mailing address.</dd>
  <dt>claimed identity</dt>
  <dd>An <em>applicant’s</em> declaration of unvalidated and unverified personal <em>attributes</em>.</dd>
  <dt>core attributes</dt>
  <dd>The set of identity <em>attributes</em> that the <em>CSP</em> has determined and documented to be required for <em>identity proofing</em>.</dd>
  <dt>credential service provider (CSP)</dt>
  <dd>A trusted entity whose functions include <em>identity proofing</em> <em>applicants</em> to the identity service and registering <em>authenticators</em> to <em>subscriber accounts</em>. A CSP may be an independent third party.</dd>
  <dt>credible source</dt>
  <dd>An entity that can provide or validate the accuracy of <em>identity evidence</em> and <em>attribute</em> information. A credible source has access to attribute information that was validated through an <em>identity proofing</em> process or that can be traced to an <em>authoritative source</em>, or it maintains identity attribute information obtained from multiple sources that is checked for data correlation for accuracy, consistency, and currency.</dd>
  <dt>digital identity</dt>
  <dd>An <em>attribute</em> or set of attributes that uniquely describes a <em>subject</em> within a given context.</dd>
  <dt>digital signature</dt>
  <dd>An <em>asymmetric key</em> operation in which the <em>private key</em> is used to digitally sign data and the <em>public key</em> is used to verify the signature. Digital signatures provide <em>authenticity</em> protection, integrity protection, and <em>non-repudiation</em> support but not confidentiality or <em>replay attack</em> protection.</dd>
  <dt>disassociability</dt>
  <dd>Enabling the <em>processing</em> of PII or events without association to individuals or devices beyond the operational requirements of the system. <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63a/references/#ref-NISTIR8062">[NISTIR8062]</a></dd>
  <dt>electronic authentication (e-authentication)</dt>
  <dd>See <em>digital authentication</em>.</dd>
  <dt>enrollment</dt>

  <dt>Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)</dt>
  <dd>Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106), the Secretary of Commerce approves the standards and guidelines that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops for federal computer systems. NIST issues these standards and guidelines as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for government-wide use. NIST develops FIPS when there are compelling federal government requirements, such as for security and interoperability, and there are no acceptable industry standards or solutions. See background information for more details.
