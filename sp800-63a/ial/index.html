    Identity Assurance Level 1 Requirements <a href="#IAL1" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Identity proofing processes at IAL1 allow for a range of acceptable techniques in order to detect the fraudulent claims to identities by malicious actors, while facilitating user adoption, minimizing the rejection of legitimate users, and reducing application departures. The use of biometric matching, such as the automated comparison of a facial portrait to supplied evidence, at IAL1 is optional, providing pathways to proofing and enrollment where such collection may not be viable.</p>
<h3 id="proofing-types" data-section="4">
  
  
    Proofing Types <a href="#proofing-types" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<ol>
  <li>IAL1 Identity Proofing <strong>MAY</strong> be delivered through any proofing type, as described in <a href="/800-63-4/sp800-63a/proofing/#ProofingTypes">Sec. 2.1.3</a>.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong>SHALL</strong> offer Unattended Remote identity proofing as an option.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong>SHALL</strong> offer at least one method of Attended (Remote or Onsite) identity proofing as an option.</li>
  <li>CSPs MAY combine proofing types and their stated requirements to create hybrid processes. For example, a CSP might leverage remote unattended identity proofing validation processes in advance of a remote attended session where verification will take place. Where such steps are combined, CSPs SHALL document their processes in alignment of requirements of each proofing type that is applied.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ial1-evidence-collection" data-section="4">
  
  
    Evidence Collection <a href="#ial1-evidence-collection" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>For each identity proofing type, the CSP <strong>SHALL</strong> collect the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>One piece of FAIR evidence or better (i.e., STRONG, SUPERIOR) evidence</li>
</ol>

<p>For onsite attended identity proofing at IAL1, organizations <strong>SHOULD</strong> prioritize the use of evidence (FAIR or STRONG) that contains a facial portrait, which can be used for verification purposes. While forms of evidence that do not contain a facial portrait <strong>MAY</strong> be used for such sessions, the associated verification requirements (e.g., returning a confirmation code) may result in additional burden on applicants.</p>
<h3 id="ial1-attribute-collection" data-section="4">
  
  
    Attribute Collection <a href="#ial1-attribute-collection" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>The CSP <strong>SHALL</strong> collect all Core Attributes. Validated evidence is the preferred source of identity attributes. If the presented identity evidence does not provide all the attributes that the CSP considers core attributes, it <strong>MAY</strong> collect attributes that are self-asserted by the applicant.</p>
<h3 id="ial1-evidence-validation" data-section="4">
  
  
    Evidence Validation <a href="#ial1-evidence-validation" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>Each piece of evidence presented <strong>SHALL</strong> be validated using one of the following techniques:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Confirming the authenticity of digital evidence through interrogation of digital security features (e.g., signatures on assertions or data).</li>
  <li>Confirming the authenticity of physical evidence using automated scanning technology able to detect physical security features.</li>
  <li>Confirming the integrity of physical security features of presented evidence through visual inspection by a proofing agent using real-time or asynchronous processes (e.g., offline manual review).</li>
  <li>Confirming the integrity of physical security features through physical and tactile inspection of security features by a proofing agent at an onsite location.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ial1-attribute-validation" data-section="4">
  
  
    Attribute Validation <a href="#ial1-attribute-validation" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<ol>
  <li>The CSP <strong>SHALL</strong> validate all core attributes and the government identifier against an authoritative or credible source to determine accuracy.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong>SHOULD</strong> correlate the data on evidence, self-asserted, and as presented by credible and authoritative sources for consistency.</li>
  <li>CSPs <strong>SHOULD</strong> validate the reference numbers of presented identity evidence if available.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ial1-verification" data-section="4">
  
  
    Verification Requirements <a href="#ial1-verification" class="header-link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>The CSP <strong>SHALL</strong> verify the applicant’s ownership of one piece of evidence using one of the following processes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Confirming the applicant’s ability to return a confirmation code delivered to a validated address associated with the evidence;</li>
  <li>Confirming the applicant’s ability to return a micro-transaction value delivered to a validated financial or similar account;</li>
  <li>Confirming the applicant’s ability to successfully complete an authentication and federation protocol equivalent to AAL2/FAL2, or higher, to access an account related to the identity evidence;</li>
  <li>Comparing the applicant’s facial image to a facial portrait on evidence via an automated comparison.</li>
  <li>Visually comparing the applicant’s facial image to a facial portrait on evidence, or in records associated with the evidence, during either an onsite attended session (in-person with a proofing agent), a remote attended session (live video with a proofing agent), or an asynchronous process (i.e., visual comparison made by a proofing agent at a different time).</li>
  <li>Comparing a stored biometric on identity evidence, or in authoritative records related to the evidence, to a sample provided by the applicant.</li>
</ol>

</h2>
    

<p>IAL2 identity proofing includes additional evidence, validation, and verification requirements in order to provide increased mitigation against impersonation attacks and other identity proofing errors relative to IAL1. IAL2 can be achieved through a number of different types of proofing (e.g., remote unattended, remote attended, etc.) and identity verification at IAL2 can be accomplished with or without the use of biometrics. To provide clear options to achieving IAL2, this section presents three different pathways to achieving alignment with IAL2 outcomes and requirements: IAL2 Verification - Non-Biometric Pathway; IAL2 Verification - Biometric Pathway; and IAL2 Verification - Digital Evidence Pathway. These different options do not imply different security or assurance outcomes; instead they present requirements in a manner that allows for clear selection of non-biometric methods that can be used to achieve IAL2.</p>

  <li>The CSP <strong>MAY</strong> request that the applicant bring the identity evidence used during the proofing process to the issuance event to further strengthen the process of binding the authenticators to the applicant.</li>
